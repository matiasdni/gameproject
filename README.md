# Unity Development Course Project

Welcome to my Unity Development Course Project! This is a quick prototype that was developed in approximately 1-1.5 weeks, so it may be unpolished and is not intended to be a complete game.

## How to Play

To start the game, navigate to the platform in the middle of the arena and press the button with the "E" key.

Use the WASD keys to control your character, and use the mouse2 button to rotate the camera in a fixed place. Use the mouse1 button to shoot your weapon.

You can switch between weapons using the 1 and 2 keys, and reload your weapon with the "R" key. The weapon will also automatically reload when there are no bullets left.

Waves of enemies will keep spawning until the player loses all of their health.

The game can currently be played at the following website: https://users.metropolia.fi/~matiasdn/Pelikehitys/

Have fun!
